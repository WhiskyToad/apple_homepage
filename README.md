Project to clone an old Apple homepage.

What I learned:

1. Getting the background image to be cropped correctly took a lot of fiddling, %'s after the url and then attributing it the billboard id to get it the same size as container.

2. Using "z-index" to get something displayed on top.

3. Having a gradient as a background.
